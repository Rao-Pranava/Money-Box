Open the `/blogs` page on a web browser. (`http://192.168.0.7/blogs/`).

We see a user who has already hacked this box and has a hint for us.... Open the source code of this page.

The secret directory is `S3cr3t-T3xt`

Browse to the secret directory (`http://192.168.0.7/S3cr3t-T3xt/`)

!

Sure, there is nothing on this directory, so... again open the source code of this web page.

We got a secret key!!! `3xtr4ctd4t4`.
